# ppm control
this is basic code to read the PPM data from the receiver.
Contains two code 
1. Hardware interrupt
  deploys hardware interrupt pin to get data from the receiver
2. PCINT
  utilizes the pin change interrupt to get data from the receiver.

use any of these code as per need, these are tested only for observing data might 
give some trouble when integrated with other system as motor controls and sensor
interfacing. So do provide feedbacks.
